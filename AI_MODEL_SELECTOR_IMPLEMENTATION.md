# AI Model Selector Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented an AI model selector in agent modal windows that allows users to choose between different AI models (ChatGPT-4, Claude-2, Gemini Pro) for their conversations with agents.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. UI Components Added

- **Model Selector Button**: Added a Settings icon button in the ChatWindow header
- **Dropdown Menu**: Interactive dropdown with model options and descriptions
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows current selected model and highlights active selection
- **Model Display**: Shows currently selected model in the info bar under header

### 2. Backend Integration

- **AgentService Updates**: Modified `generateAgentResponse()` to accept `selectedModel` parameter
- **API Integration**: Ensures selected model is passed to AI service instead of agent's default model
- **Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for model selection and usage analytics

### 3. State Management

- **Per-Agent Storage**: Each agent remembers its selected model in localStorage
- **Session Integration**: Chat sessions track and use selected model
- **Automatic Loading**: Selected model is restored when reopening agent chat

### 4. User Experience

- **Persistent Selection**: Model choice persists across chat sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current model in UI
- **Seamless Integration**: Model selector integrates naturally with existing UI

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`src/components/ChatWindow.tsx`**

   - Added model selector UI components
   - Implemented model state management
   - Added localStorage persistence
   - Updated API calls to pass selected model

2. **`src/services/agentService.ts`**
   - Added `selectedModel` parameter to `generateAgentResponse()`
   - Modified model selection logic to use user choice over agent default
   - Enhanced logging for model usage tracking

### API Changes

```typescript
// Before
agentService.generateAgentResponse(
  message,
  agent,
  history,
  userId,
  skipCredits,
  sessionId
);

// After
agentService.generateAgentResponse(
  message,
  agent,
  history,
  userId,
  skipCredits,
  sessionId,
  selectedModel
);
```

### Storage Structure

```typescript
// LocalStorage keys for model preferences
`agent_model_${agentId}`; // Stores selected model for each agent
```

## Available Models

- **ChatGPT-4**: Most advanced reasoning and creativity
- **Claude-2**: Excellent for analysis and long-form content
- **Gemini Pro**: Great for multimodal tasks and coding

## User Workflow

1. User opens agent chat modal
2. Clicks Settings button in header to access model selector
3. Selects preferred AI model from dropdown
4. Model choice is saved and displayed in UI
5. All subsequent messages use selected model
6. Model preference persists for future sessions with that agent

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Users can choose the best model for their specific use case
- **Personalization**: Different agents can have different preferred models
- **Transparency**: Users always know which model they're using
- **Performance**: Optimal model selection for different types of tasks

## Future Enhancements

- Model performance indicators
- Usage statistics per model
- Model-specific pricing information
- Quick model switching during conversation
