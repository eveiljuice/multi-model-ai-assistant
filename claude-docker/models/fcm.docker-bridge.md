# Formal Conceptual Model: Docker Bridge Implementation

## Layer 1: Atomic Concepts (Foundational Axioms)

### Primary Axioms
**Container**: A boundary creating isolated execution space.  
**Image**: A template defining container contents and behavior.  
**Volume**: A mechanism for sharing data across boundaries.  
**Network**: A pathway enabling communication between containers.

### Derived Atomic Concepts
**Mount**: Any volume connection bridging container and host boundaries.  
**Isolation**: Any separation preserving distinct execution environments.  
**Orchestration**: Any coordination of multiple container lifecycles.  
**Registry**: Any storage for reusable container images.

## Layer 2: Atomic Conceptual Components (Core Definitions)

### Container Architecture
**Container Runtime**: Any system executing isolated processes from images.  
**Host System**: Any underlying platform providing container execution capability.  
**Container Boundary**: Any isolation mechanism separating container from host.  
**Lifecycle Management**: Any control over container creation, execution, and destruction.

### Bridge Mechanisms  
**Volume Mount**: Any directory sharing between host and container filesystems.  
**Network Bridge**: Any communication pathway between containers or container-to-host.  
**Port Mapping**: Any network pathway from host to container services.  
**Environment Bridge**: Any variable sharing from host to container execution context.

## Layer 3: Conceptual Components (Operational Definitions)

### Docker Sidecar Implementation
**Sidecar Container**: Any container existing beside primary application container.  
**Shared Volume**: Any mount enabling data exchange while preserving boundary.  
**Service Network**: Any docker network enabling inter-container communication.  
**Compose Orchestration**: Any docker-compose configuration defining sidecar relationships.

### Bridge Patterns
**Configuration Bridge**: Volume mount sharing configuration files across boundary.  
**Data Bridge**: Volume mount enabling persistent data access.  
**Tool Bridge**: Container providing tools to primary application environment.  
**Monitoring Bridge**: Sidecar observing primary container without interference.

### State Manifestations
**Solid**: Fixed container configuration with predetermined mounts and networks.  
**Liquid**: Dynamic configuration adapting to host environment discovery.  
**Gas**: Service mesh with containers discovering and connecting automatically.  
**Plasma**: Self-healing container systems responding to failure patterns.

## Layer 4: Implementation Mappings

### Sidecar Pattern → Docker Implementation
**Beside Relationship** → Containers in same docker-compose service group  
**Boundary Preservation** → Container isolation with explicit volume/network bridges  
**Supplemental Capability** → Sidecar container providing tools/services to primary  
**Autonomous Operation** → Independent container lifecycles with restart policies  

### FCM Principles → Docker Configuration
**Lateral System** → Peer containers without parent-child dependencies  
**Resource Sharing** → Volume mounts with appropriate read/write permissions  
**Interface Boundary** → Network communication through defined ports/protocols  
**Lifecycle Independence** → Separate container definitions allowing independent scaling

## Layer 5: Configuration Patterns

### Docker Compose Structure
```yaml
# FCM-Compliant Sidecar Pattern
services:
  primary-app:
    # Primary application container
    image: primary/application
    volumes:
      - app-data:/data
    networks:
      - app-network
    
  sidecar-tools:
    # Sidecar providing supplemental capability
    image: sidecar/tools
    volumes:
      - app-data:/data:ro          # Shared data, read-only for sidecar
      - ./config:/config:ro        # Configuration bridge
      - ./models:/models:ro        # FCM models bridge
    networks:
      - app-network                # Communication bridge
    depends_on:
      - primary-app
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  app-data:                        # Shared persistent storage

networks:
  app-network:                     # Communication pathway
```

### Volume Mount Patterns
**Configuration Mount**: `./config:/container/config:ro` (read-only config bridge)  
**Model Mount**: `./models:/container/models:ro` (read-only model bridge)  
**Data Mount**: `./data:/container/data:rw` (read-write data bridge)  
**Tool Mount**: `./tools:/container/tools:ro` (read-only tool bridge)  

### Network Bridge Patterns
**Internal Network**: Containers communicate via docker network (isolation preserved)  
**Port Exposure**: Selected ports mapped to host (controlled boundary opening)  
**Service Discovery**: Containers locate each other via service names (automatic bridge)  
**External Access**: Load balancer or proxy provides controlled external access

## Layer 6: Implementation Requirements

### FCM Compliance Validation
1. **Boundary Test**: Each container can be removed without breaking others
2. **Independence Test**: Containers have separate lifecycle controls
3. **Capability Test**: Sidecar provides value without primary modification  
4. **Bridge Test**: Communication works through defined interfaces only

### Security Boundaries
**Filesystem Isolation**: Containers access only explicitly mounted volumes  
**Network Isolation**: Containers communicate only through defined networks  
**Process Isolation**: Container processes cannot access host or other containers  
**Resource Isolation**: Resource limits prevent one container affecting others  

### Operational Requirements
**Health Checks**: Each container reports its health independently  
**Restart Policies**: Failed containers restart without affecting others  
**Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource conflicts  
**Logging Strategy**: Each container logs independently for troubleshooting

## Layer 7: Bridge Quality Metrics

### Performance Measures
**Mount Latency**: Time for volume operations across container boundary  
**Network Latency**: Communication time between containers  
**Resource Overhead**: Additional resources required for containerization  
**Startup Time**: Time from compose up to functional system  

### Reliability Measures  
**Isolation Effectiveness**: Degree failures remain contained  
**Bridge Stability**: Consistency of cross-container communication  
**Recovery Time**: Time to restore function after component failure  
**Configuration Drift**: Tendency for runtime to deviate from definition  

### Development Experience
**Configuration Clarity**: Ease of understanding system relationships  
**Debug Accessibility**: Ability to inspect and modify running system  
**Iteration Speed**: Time from code change to running system  
**Environment Consistency**: Similarity between development and production

## Layer 8: Essential Bridge Nature

### Core Implementation Principle
Docker bridges sidecar pattern to container runtime by preserving FCM principles within container isolation boundaries while enabling practical deployment and orchestration.

### Bridge Completeness
This model enables:
- Translation from conceptual sidecar to concrete container implementation
- Validation that container architecture maintains FCM compliance
- Quality measurement of bridge effectiveness
- Evolution path from simple containers to sophisticated service architectures

### Self-Reference
This docker-bridge model demonstrates bridge pattern itself:
- Connects abstract FCM concepts to concrete Docker implementation
- Preserves conceptual integrity while enabling practical deployment
- Operates independently while enhancing understanding
- Supplements FCM theory with implementation guidance

### Model Parameters
- **Domain**: Container orchestration implementing sidecar patterns
- **Scale**: From single-container sidecars to service mesh architectures
- **Perspective**: λ ≈ 0.4 (balanced toward practical implementation)
- **Completeness**: Complete bridge enabling FCM-compliant containerization
